-Customer Analytics & Store Trial Evaluation (Quantium – Forage)

This repository contains an end-to-end retail data analytics project completed as part of the Quantium Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage).
The project focuses on customer purchasing behaviour analysis and store trial uplift testing using Python to deliver business-ready insights and strategic recommendations.

=> Project Structure
 -Task 1: Customer Analytics & Purchasing Behaviour
Performed data cleaning, validation, and feature engineering on transaction and customer datasets
Analyzed customer segments using LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER attributes
Identified key spend drivers using metrics such as:
Total sales
Customers per segment
Average units per customer
Built business-focused visualisations to explain purchasing patterns and volume drivers
Delivered actionable category recommendations for senior stakeholders

 -Task 2: Experimentation & Uplift Testing
Evaluated store trials conducted in Stores 77, 86, and 88
Selected control stores using Pearson correlation on pre-trial sales trends
Compared trial vs control performance during the trial period
Measured sales uplift and identified drivers:
Increase in number of customers
Increase in transactions per customer
Assessed trial success and provided scaling recommendations

- Key Business Insights
Family and mainstream customers are the primary drivers of chip sales volume
Higher spend is driven by more units purchased, not higher prices
Store trials showed a clear positive uplift, mainly driven by increased customer traffic
Trial strategy is scalable to similar stores with low risk
